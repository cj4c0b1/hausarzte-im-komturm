The e-prescription is not stored on your insurance card, but on a specially secured server. Pharmacies can retrieve this prescription with your insurance card and dispense the medication to you.\n\nPlease note: Before we can issue you an e-prescription, it is necessary to first have your insurance card read at our practice. Only then can we issue you an e-prescription. Unfortunately, there may be a time delay between issuing the prescription and redeeming it at the pharmacy, so you should plan for the e-prescription to be redeemable at the pharmacy the following day."
